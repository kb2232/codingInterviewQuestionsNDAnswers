# // The two sum problem
# // 1. given array [2,7, 5, 1], and target=9
# // 2. return the indices of any two elements that add to the target;
# // 3. assume that each input will have exactly ONE sulution. You may not use same element twice

# // An O(n^2) solution will be to go through the loop twice
# // and compare each elements - return both indices once you find the target
